# session and select another tmux session" (http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/58588/kill-a-tmux-session-and-select-another-tmux-session)
# This hack relies on fact, that "default" client (for `switch-client -n`) and
# "default" session (for #S in `display-message -p`) are last active ones. If
# during execution of this shell command, any other tmux client will receive
# _any_ input, it'll become "default" and command will fail. Though, this
# command should run from shell, because after killing current session from
# inside tmux, no other commands may be executed (client detached). If i
# switch first, i have no way to determine the name of previous session (i
# think).
# Note, that i execute `switch-client` and `kill-session` in different _shell_
# commands, because otherwise, if this is the last session and `switch-client`
# failes, `kill-session` will not be executed at all.

# of existing buffers. Pasting from X selection does the same to tmux buffers,
# so it should have the same controls avaiable - paste and rotate (like select
# and copy from copy-mode) or paste to specified buffer (like select and copy
# with "repeat count" from copy-mode). Similarly, pasting from tmux buffer has
# two controls - paste top level buffer or choose buffer to paste and move it
# on top of stack (with stack rotation); thus, copy to X clipboard should also
# have these two options. The equivalence of this operations may be observed
# in this way: copying from copy-mode is "put in tmux buffer", and copying
# from X selection is also "put in tmux buffer"; the same - paste from tmux
# buffer is "get from tmux buffer", and copy to X selection is also "get from
