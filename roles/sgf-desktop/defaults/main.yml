# System firefox .desktop entry names (which to overwrite). Note, that i
# should overwrite _all_ entries, otherwise ones left intact may break
# profile.
firefox_desktop_names:
  - 'firefox.desktop'
  - 'firefox-esr.desktop'
  - 'iceweasel.desktop'
# FIXME: Rename to 'firefox-system-profile'
# Profile name to hardcode into .desktop files launching _system_ firefox.
firefox_system_profile: 'default'
# Which firefox to use as default browser (default mime handler for urls,
# etc).
firefox_default_desktop: 'firefox-52esr.desktop'

# Firefox versions to install.
#   - 'name' is unique name (required). It's used to derive directory, where
#   to unpack (i.e. install), and .desktop file name. Also, when deriving
#   'profile' name (if omitted), starting 'firefox-' prefix in 'name' will be
#   replaced with word 'default'. I.e. 'name' structure "firefox-X", where X
#   is some reference to firefox version, is assumed (though, not required).
#   - 'url' is download url. Instead i may specify 'version' and 'lang' and
#   'url' will be guessed.
#   - 'lang' is language to use. This may be used to construct url. Though,
#   note, that these are _not_ locale language codes. E.g. for russian
#   version, i should use just `ru`. Check the
#   https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/ download link to ensure the
#   code is correct. Language and country separator may be '_' or '-'.
#   - 'version' is version to install. See
#   https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/ for a list of valid
#   versions.  Also, word 'latest' is recognized.
#   - 'archive' is name under which to save downloaded archive. If omitted,
#   it'll be derived from last component of url.
#   - 'profile' is profile name to hardcode into .desktop file. If omitted,
#   it'll be derived from 'name' (see above about 'name').
#   - 'comment' is description used in desktop entry in 'Comment' and
#   'X-GNOME-FullName' fields.

# Overwrite files normally left untoched. Set this only _once_ for overwriting

# This dictionary is used by several roles (e.g. `sgf-console` and
# `sgf-desktop`). This role initializes only part of its keys from
# `desktop_colors` dictionary. To overwrite particular keys, set them in
# parent task.
colors: {}

# Default for _all_ `colors` dictionary keys (overwriting role default value).
# But particular `colors` key set explicitly in parent task will overwrite
# this value. This variable used by several roles (e.g. `sgf-console` and
# `sgf-desktop`).
# all_colors: 'disabled'

# Directory where to download and save locally installed programs and files.
